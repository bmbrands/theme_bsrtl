/**
 * Theme More settings.
 *
 * Each setting that is defined in the parent theme Clean should be
 * defined here too, and use the exact same config name. The reason
 * is that theme_bsrtl does not define any layout files to re-use the
 * ones from theme_clean. But as those layout files use the function
 * {@link theme_clean_get_html_for_settings} that belong to Clean,
 * we have to make sure it works as expected by having the same settings
 * in our theme.
